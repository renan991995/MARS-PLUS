# MARS+: Molecular Assembly and Representation Suite - Plus


## MARS: the prototype

In computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) [1][2], the capability of generating new molecular species from existing one is vital. 
[MARS program](https://github.com/hsuhsuanhao/MARS) [3], devised for such demand, consists of two components: 

* **Molecular data structure (MDS)** : base elements and 5 arrays of integers
* **Genetic operators**              : ring formation, addition, subtraction, exchange, crossover, and combination

To initiate a MARS task, one should input the 3D structures of starting molecules. 
These structures will then be converted into MDS representation, where a structure is recognized as a network of base elements. 
Each of the genetic operators will be applied to each of the possible substructures in each of the MDSs. 
As a result, a number of new species can be generated.  



## MARS+: what is new in it?

MARS+ is based on MARS [3], with various improvements:

1. **The expansion of base element library**

        1-1. Group-like elements are allowed.
        1-2. Cationic cores and anionic cores are included.
		1-3. The library is not hard-coded. 
		     It can be appended easily. (See the instructions in inputs/element_lists/element_list.txt)


2. **The generalization of MDS**

		2-1. An additional array of integers is used to bookkeep optical isomerisms.
		2-2. Two additional arrays of integers are used to bookkeep cis-trans isomerisms.
		2-3. An additional array of integers is used to bookkeep cyclic bonds.
		2-4. Multiple ring numbers on an atom are allowed.
		2-5. The representation of a two-component chemical is allowed. 
		     Equimolar ionic liquids (1:1) are taken as examples.


3. **The generalization of genetic operators**

		3-1. Refinement of old operators:
			 3-1-1. The feasibility of molecular connectivity is ensured after subtraction operation.
			 3-1-2. Multiple ring numbers on an atom can be induced through cyclization operator.
			 3-1-3. For most of the operators, the codes are revised for better systematicness.
			        Unnecessary dependencies among variables are reduced.
			 3-1-4. The stability and flexibility of operators are enhanced. 
		3-2. Development of new operators: insertion, decyclization, element change, cis-trans inversion, chirality inversion, and component switch.
		3-3. Since the new operator scheme has a better reversibility, undoing an operation is much easier now. 
	         This can reduce unintended biases toward the generation of certain molecules (e.g. polycyclics).
		3-4. Check isomerisms of substructures after an operation is successfully conducted.
		     Assign default isomerisms (i.e. trans and clockwise winding) to potentially isomeric substructures.
		3-5. If an imine-like substructure is present, indicate the lone pair of nitrogen atom by a null atom "*".


4. **Wrapping some Open Babel [4] functions into MARS+**

		4-1. This facilitates the inputting of starting structures to the program. 
		     One only needs to input SMILES now.
		4-2. The isomerism perception for inputted molecules is more robust.


## Development environment

* Linux CentOS 6.3 (x86_64)
* Miniconda3 v4.9.2 (x86_64, py39)
* GNU g++ compiler v9.2.0 (C++11)
* Open Babel v3.1.0
* Eigen v3.3.7 
* Cmake v3.15.5
* Make v4.2



## Compiling MARS+ from source code

The MARS+ source code consists of 7 header files and 7 cpp files: (see `src/` directory)

    ELEMENTS.h    MOLECULE.h    CASES_NEU.h    CASES_IL_INDEPENDENT.h    CASES_IL.h    UTILITY.h    PARAMETER.h
    ELEMENTS.cpp  MOLECULE.cpp  CASES_NEU.cpp  CASES_IL_INDEPENDENT.cpp  CASES_IL.cpp  UTILITY.cpp  main.cpp


### For Linux users:
    
Before compiling MARS+, relevant softwares should be installed. 
With [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download), 
one can directly import `MARS+` environment along with the required packages from `MARS+_env.yml` or `MARS+_env_pipcmake.yml`. 

    conda env create --file MARS+_env_pipcmake.yml
 
(Note: `conda` may lead to a corrupted installation of `cmake`. 
Therefore, we provided an alternative `MARS+_env_pipcmake.yml`, which installs `cmake` from `pip`.)	
Now activate `MARS+` environment and compile the source code. 

    conda activate MARS+
    cd src/
    rm -r ./Makefile ./cmake_install.cmake ./CMakeCache.txt ./CMakeFiles 2> /dev/null
    cmake ./CMakeLists.txt
    make -j [N]                 ("-j [N]" is optional. It means parallel compiling with N jobs at once.)

An executable `MARS-PLUS` will be generated in `src/`.
Make sure the compiling is successful before launching MARS+ tasks, especially when you have made modifications to the code.


### For Windows users:

Please refer to the repository of [MARS+ Windows version](https://github.com/renan991995/MARS-PLUS-Wins).


## Usage

There are 3 input files for MARS+: (see `inputs/`)
        
    inputs/control.in                     : controls the input, output, and calculation options.
    inputs/element_lists/element_list.txt : a list that defines base element library.
    inputs/INPUT_CHEMICALS/IL4.txt        : the starting chemicals.
    
Please read the instructions in `inputs/control.in` and `inputs/element_lists/element_list.txt`.
Make sure you have properly set the parameters, and then launch the MARS+.


### For Linux users:

	cd src/
	./MARS-PLUS ../inputs/control.in

Alternatively, you may use the PBS scheduler. A PBS template `src/job.sh` is provided.

	cd src/
	qsub ./job.sh

The results for each of the operations will be outputted to `logs/`.
For instance, the generated chemicals by applying bond change operation to an IL will be written to `logs/change_bnd_IL.txt`.


### For Windows users:

Please refer to the repository of [MARS+ Windows version](https://github.com/renan991995/MARS-PLUS-Wins).

## Iterative molecular design

MARS+ supports the iterative molecular. 
It can be done by subjecting the molecules generated in a round to next round of exhaustive operations.
A dataset obtained in this way is provided in [IterDesignData repository](https://github.com/renan991995/MARS-PLUS-IterDesignData).
